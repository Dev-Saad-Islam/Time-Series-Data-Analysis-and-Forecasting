# Time-Series-Data-Analysis-and-Forecasting:


● Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on time series data to identify underlying patterns.

● Developed multiple candidate models, including ARIMA, Linear Regression, Exponential Smoothing, 
and Neural Networks, both manually and automatically, which were evaluated and compared against 
benchmark models (naive and seasonal naive) using error metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and SMAPE.

● Utilized the best-performing models to accurately predict two weeks of future data.
