This study delves into the comparison of various forecasting models using a specific time series dataset. To determine the most accurate model, it evaluated RMSE, MAE, sMape, and AIC scores alongside naive and seasonal naive models as benchmarks.

The comparison involved neural network and ARIMA models for predicting 14 future values. The best-performing models were ARIMA(2,0,1)(0,1,1)[7] and NNAR(10,15) with specific configurations. Plots were utilized to illustrate the expected values.

The report highlights that the accuracy of these projections may vary based on future pattern modifications or adjustments.
